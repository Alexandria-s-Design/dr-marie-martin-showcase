**DR. MARTIN:**
"What does it take to earn a doctorate while working full-time and raising a family? Is it even possible? Today, I'm sharing my EdD journey - the challenges, the triumphs, and the lessons I wish I'd known from day one. Whether you're considering a doctoral program or you're in the thick of it right now, this is for you."

## SEGMENT 1: WHY THE EdD? (0:30 - 2:30)

**DR. MARTIN:**
"Let me start with the biggest question: Why did I choose the EdD over a PhD?

For me, it came down to impact. I didn't want to be a researcher studying education from the outside. I wanted to be IN the work - leading change, solving real problems, transforming schools and systems.

The EdD - the Doctor of Education in Leadership - is designed for practitioners. It's about applying research to practice, not just conducting research. Every assignment, every project, every dissertation chapter had to connect to my work as an educational leader.

**[B-ROLL: Classroom scenes, students learning, school environments]**

The PhD is wonderful for those who want to contribute to educational theory, conduct long-term research studies, and work in higher education. But if your goal is to lead schools, districts, or educational organizations, the EdD is purpose-built for you.

Here's what made the EdD right for me:
- **Problem-based learning** - tackling real issues in my school or district
- **Cohort model** - learning alongside fellow educational leaders
- **Applied research** - my dissertation could directly improve my practice
- **Practitioner faculty** - professors who understood the realities of school leadership

The day I realized this was the right path was when my advisor said, 'Your research should make your job easier, not harder.' That's the EdD difference."

## SEGMENT 2: THE REALITY CHECK (2:30 - 4:30)

**DR. MARTIN:**
"Now, let's talk about what nobody tells you in the recruitment brochure.

**[GRAPHIC: Timeline showing work, family, and school commitments]**

Balancing a doctoral program with full-time work and family responsibilities is no joke. Here's what my week looked like:

- **Monday-Friday:** Full-time administrative role at school
- **Evenings:** 2-3 hours of reading, writing, or online coursework
- **Weekends:** One full day dedicated to dissertation work
- **Summer:** Intensive writing periods and research data collection

There were moments I questioned everything. I remember sitting in my car in the school parking lot at 10 PM, crying because I missed my daughter's recital to finish a literature review. I remember falling asleep mid-sentence while writing at 2 AM.

**[AUTHENTIC MOMENT - vulnerable and real]**

But here's what I learned: **It's not about balance - it's about integration.**

Instead of separating my work, my studies, and my life, I found ways to weave them together:

✓ My dissertation research focused on a challenge in MY school
✓ Course assignments became resources I could use with my staff
✓ My family learned alongside me - dinner conversations about educational theory
✓ My colleagues became my research participants and cheerleaders

The key is choosing a research topic that genuinely matters to your professional practice. Don't pick something just because it sounds impressive. Pick the problem that keeps you up at night - then solve it through your doctoral work."

## SEGMENT 3: KEY TURNING POINTS (4:30 - 6:30)

**DR. MARTIN:**
"Every doctoral journey has moments that change everything. Let me share three turning points that shaped mine.

**Turning Point 1: Finding My Voice**

In my first semester, I was intimidated by my cohort. Everyone seemed smarter, more experienced, more articulate. I stayed quiet in discussions, afraid of saying something wrong.

Then one day, my advisor pulled me aside and said, 'Marie, you're the only one in this room leading a Title I school. Your perspective isn't just valuable - it's essential.'

That changed everything. I realized I didn't need to compete with others' strengths. I needed to own mine.

**[GRAPHIC: "Your Experience Is Your Expertise"]**

**Turning Point 2: The Dissertation Pivot**

Eighteen months into my program, I had to completely change my dissertation topic. The research I'd been planning was no longer viable due to COVID-19 disrupting schools.

I panicked. All that work, gone.

But my chair helped me see it differently: 'This isn't a setback. This is an opportunity to study something even more relevant.'

I pivoted to studying how computational modeling could support remote learning in science education. That pivot led to ModelIt - the work I'm most proud of today.

**Lesson:** Flexibility isn't failure. It's wisdom.

**Turning Point 3: The Defense**

The day of my dissertation defense, I was terrified. Five hours of questions from my committee. What if I couldn't answer? What if they found a fatal flaw?

But then I realized: Nobody in the world knows my research better than I do. This isn't an interrogation. It's a celebration.

I walked in confident, defended my work, and heard those magical words: 'Congratulations, Dr. Martin.'

**[EMOTIONAL MOMENT]**

That moment wasn't just about a degree. It was about proving to myself - and my students, my daughters, every woman who's been told she's not enough - that we can do hard things."

## SEGMENT 4: ADVICE FOR YOUR JOURNEY (6:30 - 8:30)

**DR. MARTIN:**
"If you're considering an EdD or you're currently in a program, here's my advice:

**1. Choose the Right Program**

Not all EdD programs are created equal. Look for:
- **Cohort model** - peer support is crucial
- **Practitioner-focused faculty** - not just researchers
- **Flexible scheduling** - online or hybrid options
- **Dissertation in practice** - applied research, not just theoretical
- **Reputation in your field** - where are you trying to work?

**2. Build Your Support System**

You cannot do this alone. You need:
- **Family buy-in** - honest conversations about time and sacrifice
- **Workplace support** - supervisors who understand your commitments
- **Cohort connections** - these people will carry you through
- **Writing accountability partners** - regular check-ins and deadlines

**3. Protect Your Writing Time**

This is sacred. My rule: **Two hours of protected writing time, three times per week.** No emails, no phone calls, no distractions. Treat it like a doctor's appointment you can't miss.

**4. Make Your Research Matter**

Choose a dissertation topic that:
- Solves a real problem in your practice
- Could lead to publication or presentations
- Aligns with your career goals
- Genuinely excites you (you'll be living with this for 2-3 years!)

**5. Know When to Ask for Help**

There's no shame in:
- Hiring a dissertation coach
- Getting writing support
- Seeing a therapist for stress management
- Taking a semester off if you need to

Your mental health and family come first. Always.

## SEGMENT 5: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EdD AND PhD (8:30 - 9:30)

**DR. MARTIN:**
"Before we wrap up, let me clarify the EdD vs. PhD question once and for all.

**[COMPARISON GRAPHIC ON SCREEN]**

| **EdD (Doctor of Education)** | **PhD (Doctor of Philosophy)** |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| For practitioners | For researchers |
| Applied research | Theoretical research |
| Solves real-world problems | Contributes to knowledge base |
| Cohort-based learning | Independent study |
| 3-4 years (part-time) | 5-7 years (full-time) |
| Leadership in schools/districts | Faculty positions in universities |

**Neither is better. They're different.**

If you want to:
- Lead schools, districts, or educational organizations → **EdD**
- Conduct long-term research and teach at universities → **PhD**

Both are rigorous. Both are valuable. Both open doors.

The question is: What kind of impact do you want to make?"

## CLOSING (9:30 - 10:00)

**DR. MARTIN:**
"My EdD journey transformed me - not just professionally, but personally. It taught me resilience, critical thinking, and the power of research to change lives.

If you're on this journey or considering it, know this: **You are capable. Your voice matters. Your research will make a difference.**
